## Getting started with the source

Change directory into the top (this) directory of SpriteBuilder and run:

    git clone https://github.com/relrix/SpriteBuilder
    cd SpriteBuilder
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    cd scripts
    ./build_distribution.py --version 1.4.9 

You need to use the BuildDistribution.sh script the first time you build SpriteBuilder, after that you can build it from within Xcode.

## Still having trouble compiling SpriteBuilder?

It is most likely still a problem with the submodules. Edit the .git/config file and remove the lines that are referencing submodules. Then change directory into the top directory and run:

    git submodule update --init

When building SpriteBuilder, make sure that "SpriteBuilder" is the selected target (it may be some of the plug-in targets by default).
